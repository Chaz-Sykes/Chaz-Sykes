ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Chaz-Sykes!! I'm currently on deployment with the army, and I've been getting into coding
with some of the free time I have while I'm overseas. I'm interested in improving my skills and just becoming
better at coding. I don't do this full-time obviously so I might be behind most people, this is just a hobby I enjoy
for now. ðŸ™‚
